# Python Functions and Modules Assignment

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of functions and modules as part of Assignment 3 for Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python.

## Programs

### Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**File:** `assignment3_01.py`

This program:
1. Defines a function named `fact` that takes a number as an argument
2. Calculates the factorial using a loop
3. Returns the calculated factorial
4. Calls the function with a sample number (5) and prints the output

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

### Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**File:** `assignment3_02.py`

This program:
1. Asks the user for a number input
2. Uses Python's `math` module to calculate:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results

**Example Usage:**
```
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Natural logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine (radians): -0.13235175009777303
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages required (uses built-in `math` module)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Run each program separately:
   ```
   python assignment3_01.py
   python assignment3_02.py
   ```
