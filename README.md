# Python Control Structures Assignment

## Module 3: Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating fundamental control structures in Python as part of Assignment 2. The programs cover conditional statements and loop structures.

## Contents

### Task 1: Even or Odd Checker
**File:** `assignment2_01.py`

This program:
1. Takes an integer input from the user
2. Uses an if-else statement to determine if the number is even or odd
3. Displays the result

**Example Usage:**
```python
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```

### Task 2: Sum of Integers (1 to 50)
**File:** `assignment2_02.py`

This program:
1. Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50
2. Calculates the cumulative sum of these integers
3. Displays the final sum (which should be 1275)

**Example Output:**
```python
The sum of integers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the repository directory
3. Run the Python scripts:
   ```
   python assignment2_01.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   python assignment2_02.py
   ```

## Features Demonstrated
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- For loops
